      <summary>How to Play Word Weavers</summary>
      <p>Welcome to Word Weavers! Here's how to get started:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>For a **Regular Game**, you will start with <strong>16 random letter tiles</strong> drawn from a large pool of over 100 letters. For the **Daily Puzzle**, everyone receives the same specific set of 16 letters for that day.</li>
        <li>Drag and drop letters onto the <strong>12x12 grid</strong> to form words.</li>
        <li>Words must be formed <strong>crossword-style</strong> (letters must connect to form words horizontally or vertically).</li>
        <li>All letters provided must be used on the board to complete the puzzle.</li>
        <li><strong>Drawing Tiles (Regular Game):</strong> During a regular game, you can click the <strong>"Draw Tile"</strong> button to get an additional random tile from the pool to add to your hand.</li>
        <li>Click the <strong>"Done"</strong> button when you've used all your letters and believe your words are correct according to standard English.</li>
        <li>
            <strong>Letter Exchange:</strong> You can exchange letter tiles from your hand. Click "Exchange Letters", select tiles, then "Confirm Exchange".
            <ul>
                <li>In a **Regular Game**, exchanged letters are discarded from play. You'll receive three new random letters from the main pool for each one exchanged.</li>
                <li>In the **Daily Puzzle**, exchanges also provide three new letters, drawn from its unique daily set of available letters.</li>
            </ul>
            A time penalty of 15 seconds per tile exchanged is added to your total time in both modes.
        </li>
        <li>A <strong>timer</strong> will count up to track how long you take. Your score will be based on word length, letter difficulty, and a bonus for completing the puzzle quickly (the bonus decreases over the first 3 minutes).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Good luck and have fun weaving words!</p>
